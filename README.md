# Gluten
WPF MVVM Framework

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/thhr9y3b1hugiv89?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/pglaspey/gluten)

**Gluten** (from Latin **gluten**, "glue") is a mixture of proteins found in wheat and related grains, including barley and rye. **Gluten** gives elasticity to dough, helping it rise and keep its shape and often gives the final product a chewy texture.

This library started with a copy of

https://github.com/canton7/Stylet

which is based on Caliburn.Micro but only the parts that support WPF.

I have been making some major (removed built in IOC) and minor changes to suit my programming style and habits.
It is currently a work in progress and as it matures I will add some documentation.
